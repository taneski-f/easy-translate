## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vite.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```


### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)
Unit tests are meant to serve as examples - they do not represent full coverage of the codebase.

```sh
npm run test:unit
```



### Run E2E Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)
E2E tests are also provided as sample scenarios and do not cover every possible workflow.

Test execution is controlled by Playwright Inspector (should open by default for all E2E runsâ€”run in debug mode by default). Start every test execution via "Resume (F8)", and each test should end with a pause by design:

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

Or run in debug mode manually, if the above fails (see: playwright.config.ts):

```sh
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
